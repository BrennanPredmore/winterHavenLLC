            <h3><u>The Challenge</u></h3>
            <p>As we approach the end of the business cycle in the midst of the longest economic expansion in history, 
            retail investors will feel the liquidity crunch when the market experiences a downturn or recession 
            defined as a pullback of >30% in the equity markets.
            <br>
            As the realities of the recession make their way to our economy, we will see liquidity contract and when 
            the inevitable layoffs happen, retail investors are forced to liquidate their savings and retirement portfolios, 
            simply to make ends meet week to week.</p>
                <br>            
            
                    <img class="img-responsive" id="volatity" src="assets/images/volatityIMG.png" alt="volatity">
                
                    <br>
                    <br>
                
            <p>This leaves them absent during the greatest periods to “buy low.”</p>

            <p>Managing risk through properly structured hedges and using post-trade analytical tools is critical. 
            The ability to create optimal trading strategies, back-test them, execute them, and automatically generate
            reporting data through a unified platform ensures option traders create profitability and maintain real time 
            quantifiable and financial views of their positions and risk exposure. </p>

            <h5><u>The Opportunity</u></h5>
            <p>The opportunity for improved profits lies within the systematic framework used by the discretionary trader. 
                With the chance to create a single resource including all relevant data, by breaking down silos within the system 
                and through application, execution, and sharing deep expertise up and down the WHC trading community.</p>
                <br>
                <h5><u>Winter Haven Capital Solution: QuanTiles Analytics </u></h5>

            trade execution and implementation and more.</p>

        <h5><u>Challenge:</u></h5>
        <p>Hedging strategies require complex mathematics and position monitoring. There is yet to be a financial 
           tool that complements a financial advisor or wealth manager to allocate 5-10% of portfolio to building a short position.</p>

           <h5><u>Solution:</u></h5>

            <h3><u>Pre-Trade Analysis</u></h3>
            <p>Complete trade and market analysis through a rigorously defined systematic framework prior to ever making a trade</p>
            
            <h5><u>Challenge:</u></h5>
            <p>Stress testing involves modeling hypothetical scenarios of positions to evaluate the impact of possible future events. 
                Modeling these increasingly complex scenarios to better understand liquidity, credit and market risk across a wide range 
                of circumstances is a challenge retail investors face. Often the degree of complexity leaves them with no choice but to 
                not use this type of analysis at all. </p>   

                <h5><u>Solution:</u></h5>
                <p>With WHC: QuanTiles Back-testing Simulator, both hedge analytics and Value at Risk can be seen at a glance.
