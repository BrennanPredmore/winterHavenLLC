        <h3><u>The Challenge</u></h3>
        <p>As we approach the end of the business cycle in the midst of the longest economic expansion in history,
            retail investors will feel the liquidity crunch when the market experiences a downturn or recession
            defined as a pullback of >30% in the equity markets.
            <br>
            As the realities of the recession make their way to our economy, we will see liquidity contract and when
            the inevitable layoffs happen, retail investors are forced to liquidate their savings and retirement
            portfolios,
            simply to make ends meet week to week.</p>

        <br>

        <p>This leaves them absent during the greatest periods to “buy low.”</p>

        <p>Managing risk through properly structured hedges and using post-trade analytical tools is critical.
            The ability to create optimal trading strategies, back-test them, execute them, and automatically
            generate
            reporting data through a unified platform ensures option traders create profitability and maintain real
            time
            quantifiable and financial views of their positions and risk exposure. </p>

        <h5><u>The Opportunity</u></h5>
        <p>The opportunity for improved profits lies within the systematic framework used by the discretionary
            trader.
            With the chance to create a single resource including all relevant data, by breaking down silos within
            the system
            and through application, execution, and sharing deep expertise up and down the WHC trading community.
